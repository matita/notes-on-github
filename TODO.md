## Cool ideas
* idea: copy as formatted text, useful to copy a complex text e.g. on Teams
* idea: three-points menu beside note separator to do actions on a single sub-note, e.g.: 
  * display formatted
  * copy formatted
  * move to folder (it also renames file or append to existing file)
* search asana task by typing `@asana some task title` and have the autocompletion search for it
* compute maths similar to https://mathnotepad.com/ (powered by mathjs.org), displayed as widget decorator
