* some times the sha is desyncronized and after some edits it says "Invalid request.\n\n\"sha\" wasn't supplied."
* set dynamic height for CodeMirror (currently it's 100% but goes beyond if more lines of code than height)

##Â Markdown editor changes
* some styling for quotes (maybe)
* underline for URLs that are not a link
* open link when cmd+click on any URL in the text
* theme from vscode

## Done
* ~~update content on GitHub~~
* ~~make file data structure with `{ isLoading, localContent, remoteContent, sha }` etc.~~
* ~~use CodeMirror instead of textarea~~
